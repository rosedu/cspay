Sketch of an ods document, with page references in the specification.
- Temporary, of course. 
- Pages refered by #<number>
- Sections refered by $<sec.sub>
- Contents at #5 (if I see the tite page and abstract one more time, I'll
kill myself).
- Might go into the wiki to be referenced for a further discussion on
  the mailing list when it grows up.

Namespaces -- go in the root element. #33

* Document root #39
	<office:document> 
		- for standalone (single-file) documents
		- may contain all content models: metadata, application
		  settings, script, font declarations, style, auto
		  style, master style, body
	document root attributes #41
		- office:version - "1.0" or "1.1" probably
		- office:mimetype - important for standalone files
* Document metadata #42
	- may be omitted or occur multiple times
	- pre-defined vs user-defined vs custom
* Body element and document types
	- spreadsheet documents, overview only #48
* Application settings #50
	- <office:settings>
	- may be divided into multiple <config:config-item-set>
	- items are defined with <config:config-item>
	- also may contain indexed or mapped configuration settings
* Scripts #54
	- single <office:scripts> element, containing <office:script>
	  elements
* Font face declarations #55
	- forwarded to $14.6
* Styles #55
	- common styles - those supported by applications
	- automatic styles - styles assigned by default to a content
	  element; will probably be the ones used in libspreadconv
	- master styles - headers, footers, backgrounds etc
	- may be CSS2 or XSLT
	- style tags #56
* Page styles and layout
	- page layout - size, margins, header and footer height etc
	- master page - template for other pages, static elements i.e.
	  headers and footers.

Metadata #59
------------
predefined #59
	- meta:generator - specifies application which last modified the
	  file; _should_ match definition for user agents specified in
	  $14.43 or RFC2616 and should allow for version numbers
	- dc:title - specifies document title (how utterly unsurprising)
	- dc:description - brief description of document
	- meta:creation-date - creation date and time
	- dc:language - language code according to standards #64
	- meta:editing-cycles - number of editing cycles document has
	  been through. Not needed, but since applications are supposed
	  to update it, I suppose it should be added.
	- meta:document-statistic #65
user-defined #67

Text content #69
Pragraph elements content #87
Text fields #99
Text indices #149

Tables #182
-----------
	- similar to HTML4 or XSL
	- contain groups of rows, which themselves contain cells
	- columns only contain description, not cells
	- rows may have variable number of cells
table:name 
table:style-name
	- references a style:style element of type table
	- defines cell width, background etc.
	- may be an automatic or a common style
table:print #185
	- specifies if a table is printed
	- if this is true, the range of cells must be specified in
	  table:print-ranges
table:table-row #186
	- table:number-rows-repeated  - specifies the number of
	  subsequent rows which are identical to this one. Should be
	  used at least to prevent blank rows from being blindly
	  repeated.
	- table:row-style - a style:style attribute with family
	  table-row (referenced by its table:style-name); can be
	  automatic or common
	- table:default-cell-style-name - cells that don't have a
	  table:style-style use this by default; 
	- table:visibility - whether the row is _visible_, invisible
	  because of not being included in a filter (_filter_), or
	  invisible because it was hidden by the user explicitly
	  (_collapse_)
table:table-cell, table:covered-table-cell #188
	- may contain pragraphs and other text elements, as well as
	  sub-tables
	- table:covered-table-cell specifies a cell that is covered by a
	  merged cell from a nearby row or column; in spreadsheet
	  applications it is common that it has content (?)
	- table:number-columns-repeated - specifies the number of
	  subsequent identical cells; they must not be merged.
	- table:number-columns-spanned, table:number-rows-spanned -
	  specify the number of cells left and down that are merged into
	  this one; the corresponding cells must then be of type
	  table:covered-table-cell
	- table:style-name - specifies style of cell; if not specified,
	  default row type and column type are checked in this order;
	  can be either automatic or common
	- table:content-validation-name - the name of a
	  table:content-validation which specifies the rules for a cell
	  validity check; if this element is not present, the cell may
	  have arbitrary content
	-
