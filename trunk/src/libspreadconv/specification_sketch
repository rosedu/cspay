Sketch of an ods document, with page references in the specification.
- Temporary, of course. 
- Pages refered by #<number>
- Sections refered by $<sec.sub>
- Contents at #5 (if I see the tite page and abstract one more time, I'll
kill myself).
- Might go into the wiki to be referenced for a further discussion on
  the mailing list when it grows up.

Namespaces -- go in the root element. #33

* Document root #39
	<office:document> 
		- for standalone (single-file) documents
		- may contain all content models: metadata, application
		  settings, script, font declarations, style, auto
		  style, master style, body
	document root attributes #41
		- office:version - "1.0" or "1.1" probably
		- office:mimetype - important for standalone files
* Document metadata #42
	- may be omitted or occur multiple times
	- pre-defined vs user-defined vs custom
* Body element and document types
	- spreadsheet documents, overview only #48
* Application settings #50
	- <office:settings>
	- may be divided into multiple <config:config-item-set>

	- also may contain indexed or mapped configuration settings
* Scripts #54
	- single <office:scripts> element, containing <office:script>
	  elements
* Font face declarations #55
	- forwarded to $14.6
* Styles #55
	- common styles - those supported by applications
	- automatic styles - styles assigned by default to a content
	  element; will probably be the ones used in libspreadconv

	- may be CSS2 or XSLT
	- style tags #56
* Page styles and layout
	- page layout - size, margins, header and footer height etc

	  headers and footers.

Metadata #59
------------
predefined #59
	- meta:generator - specifies application which last modified the
	  file; _should_ match definition for user agents specified in
	  $14.43 or RFC2616 and should allow for version numbers
	- dc:title - specifies document title (how utterly unsurprising)
	- dc:description - brief description of document
	- meta:creation-date - creation date and time
	- dc:language - language code according to standards #64
	- meta:editing-cycles - number of editing cycles document has
	  been through. Not needed, but since applications are supposed
	  to update it, I suppose it should be added.
	- meta:document-statistic #65
user-defined #67

Tables #182
